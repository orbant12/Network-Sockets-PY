        <p> 
            If you can see this line in your browser, you already worked with HTTP more than most of the programmers ever did or will do! 
            We, Computer Networks Team, want to congratulate you with this achievement!
        </p>

        <p>
            Apart from the assignment points, we want to award you with two cutest cat images we could find.
            If you can see those, that means your HTTP server can load images as well. Congrats #2!
        </p>
